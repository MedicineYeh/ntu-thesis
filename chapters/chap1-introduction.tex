One can find papers with its bib on \emph{Google Scholar}.
Citation is simple~\cite{yeh2016flattened,intel_ocl_spm}, but remember that space after comma is not allowed.

Please draw figures by yourself as possible and export to pdf format, which contains words and vector graphics.
Two methods can be used to reference a figure, ex: reference the number Figure~\ref{fig:simple_figure}.
Remember the "\textasciitilde" is required to force an empty space before the referenced number.
The other way is using auto reference which generates the text for you as well, \autoref{fig:simple_figure}
If you apply auto reference on table, the text will be set to~\autoref{table:simple_table} and~\autoref{table:big_table}.

\begin{figure}[tbh!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/flowchart}
\caption{Flow chart of something}
\label{fig:simple_figure}
\end{figure}

Tables are usually too long, we suggest to put all tables in external files.

\input{tables/simple_table}

\input{tables/big_table}

Codes can be written/colored in two ways.
Listing~\autoref{fig:code_wordcount} and Minted~\autoref{fig:code_wordcount_minted}.
Usually, \emph{listing} is more prefered because the results from \emph{minted} is \textbf{too fancy}.
In addition, \emph{minted} takes more time to prcess and generates \emph{\_minted-*} directory.

\input{codes/map-code}

Algorithm in pseudo code can be written as demoed in \autoref{alg:simple_algorithm}.

\input{codes/algorithm-demo}

HTML output can be done by \emph{make html} command.
One can use this to generate text, i.e. list of figures and bibliography, for copying to website when submitting thesis.
